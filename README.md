This Python script collects data from Lichess Fishnet hourly and saves it to a CSV file.

## Description

Lichess Fishnet ( <https://github.com/lichess-org/fishnet)>) is a network analysis and simulation tool. This script reads data from the `.fishnet-stats` JSON file, which Fishnet automatically generates and updates. This file contains key statistical information about the analyzed network, such as the number of nodes, connections, and other metrics.  The script extracts `total_batches`, `total_positions`, and `total_nodes` from this file, and saves them along with a timestamp in `FishnetCSV1.csv`.

## Prerequisites

-   Windows 10 or later
-   Python 3.x (tested with version 3.9) - <https://www.python.org/downloads/>
-   Fishnet must be installed and configured to generate the `.fishnet-stats` file in the user's home directory (`C:\Users\<Username>\.fishnet-stats`).  Fishnet's documentation should be consulted for details on how to enable and configure statistics generation.
-   Write access to the directory where the CSV file will be created.

## Installation

1.  Install Python (see link above). Select the "Add Python to PATH" option during installation.
2.  Save the script: `FishnetToCSV.py` in a folder of your choice.

## Usage

1.  Open PowerShell.
2.  Navigate to the script: `cd C:\Path\to\Script`.
3.  Run the script: `python FishnetToCSV.py` or `py FishnetToCSV.py`

## Configuration

-   `.fishnet-stats`: Path relative to the user's home directory.
-   `FishnetCSV1.csv`: Name of the CSV file.

## Example

CSV file columns:

-   `Timestamp`: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`
-   `Total Batches`
-   `Total Positions`
-   `Total Nodes`

# Fishnet Data Visualization with Tkinter and Matplotlib (Windows Edition)

This Python script creates an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter and Matplotlib to display and analyze data from a CSV file (`FishnetCSV1.csv`) on Windows.

## Description
![Sample of Fishcount CMD](https://github.com/ounben/fishcount/blob/main/Sample%20of%20Fishcount%20Graph%203%20day.png)

The script reads data from a CSV file generated by FishcountToCSV.py or a similar application. It allows the user to select a date range and view the differences in batch and node values over time. The plot includes two y-axes for the batch and node differences, as well as a variety of statistical information displayed in the title.

## Prerequisites

- Windows 10 or later
- Python 3.x (tested with version 3.9) - It is recommended to install Python from the official Python website: <https://www.python.org/downloads/>. Make sure to select the "Add Python to PATH" option during installation.
- The CSV file `FishnetCSV1.csv` must exist and be located in the same directory as the script or a directory accessible via the path. The file should contain the columns 'Timestamp', 'Batch', 'Position', and 'Nodes'.
- The libraries `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `tkcalendar`, and `tkinter` must be installed. You can do this with the following command in PowerShell:
  ```powershell
  py -m pip install matplotlib pandas tkcalendar
# Installation
Download the appropriate Python version for Windows from the official Python website and install it. Make sure to select the "Add Python to PATH" option during the installation.
Save the Python script (e.g., as Fishcount_Graph.py) in a folder of your choice.
Ensure that the CSV file FishnetCSV1.csv is in the same folder or a folder accessible via the path.
Usage
## Open PowerShell.
Navigate to the folder where you saved the script, e.g., using the command cd C:\Path\to\Script.
Run the script: python Fishcount_Graph.py or py fishcount_Graph.py

# Operation
After starting the script, a window with the plot, two calendars for date selection, and a button will appear.
Use the calendars to select the desired start and end date range.

Click the "Update Diagram" button to update the plot with the selected data.
The plot displays the differences in batch and node values over time.
The title of the plot contains statistical information such as the last batch value, the total amount, the average, the minimum and maximum of the batch difference, and the current time.

## Configuration
CSV File: The file name of the CSV file is set to FishnetCSV1.csv. You can change this in the script by adjusting the filename variable.
Column Names: The column names for timestamp, batch, position, and nodes are set in the script. Adjust these if your CSV file uses different column names.
Error Handling
The script handles various errors, such as the absence of the CSV file, empty files, errors when parsing the CSV file, and other unexpected errors. In case of an error, messages are displayed and/or shown in the GUI.

## Global Variables
The script uses global variables for the plot (fig, ax1, ax2, line1, line2, canvas, df), which is necessary for the Tkinter integration.

## Lambda Function
When creating the button, a lambda function is used to call the update_plot function with the correct parameters.

## Checking for None and Empty DataFrame
The script checks whether the plot objects and the DataFrame are not None and whether the filtered DataFrame is not empty before the data is updated. This prevents errors if the data has not yet been loaded or the selected period contains no data.

## Updating the Title
The title of the plot is recreated each time instead of modifying it. This is more efficient and avoids problems with the formatting of the title.

## Formatting the Timestamp
The timestamps for min and max of the batch difference are displayed in the format DD.MM.YY HH:MM.

## Messages in the GUI
Messages are displayed in the GUI if no data is found for the selected period or an error occurs.
